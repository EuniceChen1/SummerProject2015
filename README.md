#Summer Internship 2015#

##Overview of activities:##
The goal of this project is for Eunice to work under Dr. Bruno Moraes and Dr. Filipe Abdalla supervision to help calibrate and apply analysis tools being currently developed by the team to constrain cosmological parameters with SDSS/BOSS and Dark Energy Survey cross-correlations. The bulk of the work will concentrate on preparing sky maps of galaxy distributions from the SDSS photometric survey, to be used in cross-correlations with BOSS spectroscopic data sets for likelihood estimation of different combinations of cosmological parameters and calibrate redshift uncertainties.
